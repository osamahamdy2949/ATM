## 📂 Project Structure

ATM_System/
├─ ATMSystem.cpp # Main C++ source code
├─ Clients.txt # Stores all client information
├─ README.md # Project documentation

## 📄 Client Data Format (`Clients.txt`)

Each client record is stored as a **single line** using a separator `#//#`:

AccountNumber#//#PinCode#//#Name#//#Phone#//#AccountBalance


**Example:**

123456#//#1234#//#Osama Hamdy#//#01008355715#//#10000.0


- `AccountNumber`: Unique client ID  
- `PinCode`: 4-digit PIN  
- `Name`: Full name  
- `Phone`: Contact number  
- `AccountBalance`: Current account balance  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Windows OS (uses `system("cls")` and `system("pause")`)  
- C++ Compiler (C++11 or newer)  
- Console application environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in a **C++ IDE**.
3. Compile and run `ATMSystem.cpp`.
4. Login using an existing account in `Clients.txt` or add new accounts manually.
5. Follow on-screen instructions for transactions.
